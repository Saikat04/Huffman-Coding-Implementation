# Huffman Compression and Decompression in Java
This project implements the Huffman Compression algorithm in Java to efficiently compress and decompress text files. The Huffman Coding technique is used to assign variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequency, achieving optimal file compression.

## Features:
File Compression: Compresses any input file by encoding its contents using the Huffman Coding algorithm.<br>
File Decompression: Restores the original file from the compressed data.<br>
Efficient Storage: Reduces file size by assigning shorter codes to more frequent bytes.
